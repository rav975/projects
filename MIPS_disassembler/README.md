# MIPS Disassembler

MIPS 32-bit Disassembler 
- Takes a set of 32-bit MIPS instructions and disassembles it into its corresponding, human-readable MIPS assembly code
- Uses the MARS MIPS simulator from Missouri State. Found here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/
- MARS simulator must be configured so that Data starts at address 0
- The set of instructions to disassemble is held in the data section

Future Improvements:
- Read the instructions from a file
- optimize some repetitive functions
